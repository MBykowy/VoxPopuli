# Survey Participation and Results Implementation Plan

## Domain Understanding
- Survey has Questions (with different QuestionTypes)
- Questions have AnswerOptions (for choice-based questions)
- Responses are submitted by users (or anonymously)
- Answers link to Questions, Responses, and potentially AnswerOptions

## ViewModels Needed for Phase 2

### 1. TakeSurveyViewModel
- Will contain basic survey info (Title, Description)
- List of QuestionViewModels
- Password field for protected surveys
- Anonymous participation option

### 2. AnswerSubmissionViewModel
- Maps user responses to questions
- Needs to handle different question types:
  - Single choice (SelectedOptionId)
  - Multiple choice (SelectedOptionIds)
  - Text (AnswerText)
  - Rating (RatingValue)

### 3. Result Visualization ViewModels
- SurveyResultViewModel (survey metadata + aggregated results)
- QuestionResultViewModel (question metadata + answers summary)
- OptionResultViewModel (for choice questions - counts and percentages)
- ChartDataViewModel (for Chart.js integration)

## Controller Actions Needed
1. ResponsesController
   - Take (GET): Display survey for participation
   - Take (POST): Submit survey responses
   - ThankYou (GET): Confirmation page

2. SurveysController (Results action)
   - Results (GET): Display survey results with visualizations

## Views Needed
1. Responses/Take.cshtml
2. Responses/ThankYou.cshtml
3. Surveys/Results.cshtml (with chart.js integration)

## JavaScript Requirements
- Form validation for required questions
- Dynamic form behavior based on question types
- Chart.js integration for results visualization

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for ResponsesController
- Unit tests for result aggregation logic
- Integration tests for survey submission flow
# Chart.js Implementation Plan for Survey Results

## Chart Types by Question Type
1. **Single Choice & Multiple Choice Questions**
   - Bar charts or pie charts showing distribution of answers
   - X-axis: Answer options
   - Y-axis: Count or percentage of responses

2. **Rating Questions**
   - Bar chart showing distribution of ratings
   - X-axis: Rating values (1-5)
   - Y-axis: Count of responses for each rating
   - Display average rating prominently

3. **Text Questions**
   - No chart - display a list of responses
   - Consider word cloud visualization in future enhancements

## Implementation Steps
1. Add Chart.js library to the project (CDN or local)
2. Create JavaScript module for chart generation
3. Process survey data into chart-friendly format
4. Generate appropriate chart based on question type
5. Implement responsive design for charts

## Data Structure for Charts
const chartData = { labels: ['Option A', 'Option B', 'Option C'], datasets: [{ label: 'Responses', data: [12, 19, 3], backgroundColor: [ 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)', 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)', 'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)', ], borderColor: [ 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)', 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)', 'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)', ], borderWidth: 1 }] };
## Chart Configuration
- Responsive design
- Appropriate labeling and titles
- Interactive tooltips
- Color scheme consistent with application theme
